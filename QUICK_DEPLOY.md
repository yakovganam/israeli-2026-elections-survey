2. **Click:** "Deploy"
   - Render reads `render.yaml` automatically
   - Creates all resources

## 📊 MongoDB Atlas Alternative (If Needed)

If you want to use your own MongoDB:

1. Create MongoDB Atlas (free tier)
2. Get connection string
3. Set MONGODB_URI in Render environment

But **Render deployment will work without this** if backend has fallback!
